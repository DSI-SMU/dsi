As current satellite measurements rapidly magnify the accumulation of more than 40 years of scientific knowledge, new discoveries increasingly require collaborative integration and adaptation of various data-driven software components (tools). In recent years, scientists have learned how to codify tools into reusable software modules that can be chained into multi-step executable workflows. However, although computing technologies continue to improve, adoption via the sharing and reuse of modules and workflows remains a big challenge. This project tackles this challenge from a novel angle, to study how to leverage peer scientists' best practice to help facilitate the discovery and reuse of Earth science modules developed by others. Machine Learning/Deep Learning-powered service classification, semantic discovery, recommendation, automatic composition, deployment and scheduling over the cloud are our research focuses.

This project is sponored by National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
