Modern science and engineering typically require support of collaboration and workflow/process. This project extends existing single user-oriented workflow tools to support collaborative design of workflows: 1) to support real-time co-design; 2) to track how a workflow has become as it is for who has done what among multiple contributors; 3) to capture and retrieve collaboration knowledge and decision making process. Reproducibility and scalability are two major targets demanding fundamental infrastructural support.

This project is supported by National Science Foundation and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
