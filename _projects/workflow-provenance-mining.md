Collaborative data analysis has become a necessity and trend in the era of big data. In such collaborative environments, intellectual property protection mechanisms are critical to maintain and encourage research partnerships. Such mechanisms shall protect not only data sources and data analysis algorithms, but also protect data provenance. However, existing mechanisms do not provide such fine-grained protection on multi-step data analytics procedure (workflow) provenance. To address such a challenge, this project aims to study and explore novel mechanisms to secure the access and querying over collaborative scientific workflow provenance.
